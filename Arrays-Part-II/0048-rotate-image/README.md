# [48. Rotate Image](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/)

**Difficulty:** Medium

---

## Problem Statement

You are given an `n × n` 2D matrix representing an image. Rotate the image by **90 degrees clockwise**.

You must rotate the image **in place**, which means you have to modify the input matrix directly. **Do not allocate another 2D matrix** for the rotation.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input**

```text
matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
```

**Output**

```text
[[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]
```

### Example 2

**Input**

```text
matrix = [[5,1,9,11],[2,4,8,10],[13,3,6,7],[15,14,12,16]]
```

**Output**

```text
[[15,13,2,5],[14,3,4,1],[12,6,8,9],[16,7,10,11]]
```

## Constraints

- `n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= n <= 20`
- `-1000 <= matrix[i][j] <= 1000`
