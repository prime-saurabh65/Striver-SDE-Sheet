# [75. Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/)

**Difficulty:** Medium

---

## Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored **red**, **white**, or **blue**, sort them **in-place** so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order **red**, **white**, and **blue**.

We use the integers:

- `0` → Red
- `1` → White
- `2` → Blue

You must solve this problem **without using the library's sort function**.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input**

```
nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
```

**Output**

```
[0,0,1,1,2,2]
```

---

### Example 2

**Input**

```
nums = [2,0,1]
```

**Output**

```
[0,1,2]
```

---

## Constraints

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 300`
- `nums[i]` is either `0`, `1`, or `2`

---

## Follow-up

Can you solve this problem in **one pass** using only **constant extra space**?
